So welcome to this brand new section and this is an exciting section because this is going to be all

00:05.370 --> 00:10.620
about driving traffic to your story you put an incredible amount of hard work in to get to this point.

00:10.620 --> 00:14.500
And now this is where it actually start to make some money.

00:14.590 --> 00:18.980
Now the first thing we need to do is to set up your Facebook add that account.

00:19.020 --> 00:24.330
Now I'm going to start with an apology because this is actually very difficult for me to show you because

00:24.690 --> 00:27.320
everybody is in a different situation now.

00:27.370 --> 00:28.080
For me.

00:28.200 --> 00:33.930
I have a business manager account with many many different accounts both my own personal use and also

00:33.930 --> 00:34.740
for teaching.

00:34.950 --> 00:38.580
So surely that is not going to help you if you are first getting started.

00:38.790 --> 00:40.450
So that's the bad news if you like.

00:40.590 --> 00:46.590
Now the good news is that setting up a Facebook account is free and it's also very straight forward.

00:46.590 --> 00:48.810
Now there's a couple of ways you can get this.

00:49.080 --> 00:55.350
If you go over your Facebook page you remember you set that up some time ago and click on the little

00:55.350 --> 00:56.260
arrow here.

00:56.340 --> 01:00.260
It brings up the menu and you're going to find here create ads.

01:00.300 --> 01:00.620
OK.

01:00.720 --> 01:02.500
You can see that click on create ads.

01:02.520 --> 01:05.320
And that's going to take you through the process.

01:05.340 --> 01:11.490
Now if on your Facebook page you don't see that and just simply head over to Google and type in set

01:11.490 --> 01:16.770
up Facebook advert account and you'll find plenty of instructions to guide you through.

01:16.860 --> 01:21.510
Suppose you can't hold your hand and literally show you how to do this by I hope you understand the

01:21.510 --> 01:23.190
difficulty from my point of view.

01:23.310 --> 01:27.570
But as I say the good news is is free and it's very easy to do so.

01:27.630 --> 01:32.370
Go to your Facebook page or go to Google and within a few minutes you'll be up and running and I'll

01:32.370 --> 01:36.000
see you in the next lecture where we can talk about setting up the Facebook pixel.
