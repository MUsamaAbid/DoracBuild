00:00.530 --> 00:02.820
Create your first ad is fantastic news.

00:02.820 --> 00:10.550
Now what we do at this point typically is what we call a split test sometimes called an A B test.

00:10.740 --> 00:16.860
All it is is creating a copy of your ad and changing one thing.

00:16.860 --> 00:18.100
Now why would we do that.

00:18.210 --> 00:23.920
Well we just created an ad and it's kind of like our best guess if you like.

00:24.090 --> 00:28.920
As to the best ad we could possibly come up with but we don't really know until we got there and tested

00:28.980 --> 00:29.940
on the on the market.

00:29.940 --> 00:32.400
We don't know whether it's going to respond that well or not.

00:32.640 --> 00:38.310
So what we'll do is we will basically create variations of that ad and in this case I'm just going to

00:38.310 --> 00:40.550
create one which is typically what I do.

00:40.680 --> 00:46.830
But often you'll see people create many many variations of the ad and then basically test them all and

00:46.830 --> 00:49.400
see which one performs the best.

00:49.510 --> 00:49.850
Yeah.

00:50.040 --> 00:52.710
And then drop the others.

00:52.710 --> 00:59.430
So you know it's basically a way of finding out by testing which one of your ads is going to perform

00:59.430 --> 01:00.270
the best.

01:00.300 --> 01:05.730
Now it's entirely up to you whether you do this is not compulsory by any means is definitely worth if

01:05.730 --> 01:07.640
you can doing one.

01:07.650 --> 01:09.660
So at least one variation.

01:09.660 --> 01:15.120
But sometimes you know for budgetary reasons for example because it will be another three dollars a

01:15.120 --> 01:16.360
day to be doing this.

01:16.500 --> 01:17.840
You may not want to do it.

01:17.850 --> 01:23.370
So I totally understand if you don't want to but if you can I would certainly suggest you do in fact

01:23.400 --> 01:27.070
I would strongly encourage you do it is very very important.

01:27.090 --> 01:34.350
So let's dive over to our Facebook ads now and see how we can actually put a split test together.

01:34.350 --> 01:39.270
So here we are and this is the screen I left you looking at at the end of The Last Lecture.

01:39.300 --> 01:42.810
And just to repeat I'm going to explain all these stats coming up.

01:42.930 --> 01:46.920
But right now I just want you to recognize we've got a campaign that we set up called the heart shaped

01:46.920 --> 01:48.790
dog pendant campaign one.

01:49.110 --> 01:54.900
So if you click on that you see as I'm sure you're an set one and what we're going to do is we're going

01:54.900 --> 01:58.010
to create a copy of the ad set.

01:58.050 --> 02:01.170
OK that's how we're going to do a spit test not to do that.

02:01.170 --> 02:02.060
It's very straightforward.

02:02.070 --> 02:11.320
Just basically select it and then here just hit duplicate and if you take existing campaign and just

02:11.320 --> 02:17.040
basically hit duplicate again then it will pull up an exact copy of your ad site as you can called it

02:17.070 --> 02:18.790
and set one copy.

02:18.790 --> 02:23.260
Now the only thing we're going to change because we're going to keep thing at the outset level exactly

02:23.260 --> 02:26.570
the same is simply the names are going to set to.

02:26.620 --> 02:27.150
OK.

02:27.450 --> 02:33.460
And click on publish and then once that's all been accepted just simply click on close.

02:33.840 --> 02:39.600
So now what you see is we have set one as we have before and now add set to as we just created.

02:39.630 --> 02:44.250
Now a clicking at set to I will get to the ad itself.

02:44.250 --> 02:45.840
So here it is.

02:45.840 --> 02:49.410
And this is where we're going to make one change.

02:49.410 --> 02:56.930
So what I want to do is click on edit this point as I just said we are going to make one change now.

02:56.950 --> 02:58.530
One the only one.

02:58.570 --> 03:05.380
Well if you step back and think about it we are wanting to test two different types of ads.

03:05.470 --> 03:11.080
We want to see whether making a change will make a difference to the number of people that are clicking

03:11.350 --> 03:14.170
and then ultimately buying from us.

03:14.180 --> 03:15.850
So I said changed two things.

03:15.850 --> 03:18.420
I changed the text and I also changed the image.

03:18.550 --> 03:22.400
And as a result I got 100 percent more sales than before.

03:22.450 --> 03:27.790
Now that will be great but I wouldn't know whether to attribute that to the change of the text or the

03:27.790 --> 03:29.330
change of the image.

03:29.350 --> 03:35.320
So by changing any one thing if I just simply change the image for example and my cells got by 100 percent

03:35.680 --> 03:39.040
that I know for sure that was all about the image.

03:39.040 --> 03:43.110
So I hope that makes it perfectly clear why we only ever change one thing.

03:43.180 --> 03:48.640
So here to change the image very very easy to just scroll down until we find the image we can click

03:48.640 --> 03:49.920
on clear images.

03:51.120 --> 03:54.950
And then we can select a different image.

03:55.140 --> 03:57.710
So take this one with the black background this time

04:03.400 --> 04:09.730
again maybe just do a little bit of editing make sure looks all rights go pretty happy with that.

04:09.740 --> 04:17.020
Let's just say and done.

04:17.100 --> 04:17.690
So that's it.

04:17.700 --> 04:20.440
We've changed one image and I've done this fairly quickly.

04:20.440 --> 04:22.560
To be honest that's not the best image that I want.

04:22.560 --> 04:27.060
I'd probably zoom in a little bit more and make that a bit clearer but I'm trying to make the point

04:27.300 --> 04:28.440
of the one change.

04:28.440 --> 04:30.530
That's what this lecture is all about.

04:30.720 --> 04:38.310
So here all I now need to do is click on publish once that's all done just click on close.

04:38.430 --> 04:43.710
Now just go back to the campaign where we started.

04:43.710 --> 04:50.730
And if you click on that link to the campaign and if I go into the ad set one you can see this is the

04:50.730 --> 04:54.760
one running with the white background.

04:55.320 --> 05:01.330
And if I go into it too you can see that's the one running with the black background.

05:01.350 --> 05:04.260
Now as I said right at the beginning it's not absolutely essential.

05:04.260 --> 05:07.640
I appreciate that we are now spending another $3 a day.

05:07.800 --> 05:14.410
But if you can really go for is a very very important part of advertising split testing AB testing what

05:14.400 --> 05:15.480
do you want to call it.

05:15.570 --> 05:21.060
And this is a very very basic example but it is enormously powerful and in the long run it can pay huge

05:21.150 --> 05:22.090
dividends.

05:22.110 --> 05:28.500
So congratulations not only have we set up our first ad but we now have a split test running.

05:28.740 --> 05:33.210
So in the next lecture Let's talk about what all these numbers mean because while these ads are currently

05:33.210 --> 05:38.280
in review as you can see here they'll soon be running and we're going to start seeing numbers popping

05:38.280 --> 05:38.810
up here.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.440
So be good to know what they all mean.
