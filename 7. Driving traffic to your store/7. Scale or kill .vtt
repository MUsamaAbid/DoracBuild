WEBVTT

00:02.070 --> 00:04.260
OK this is now super exciting.

00:04.260 --> 00:12.030
We have got an ad running and we are checking every five seconds to say please put something from us

00:12.030 --> 00:14.310
right there.

00:14.370 --> 00:20.790
So what do we do now we got these two ads running and we want to know how long to run them for.

00:21.000 --> 00:27.090
And you know how do we decide whether they're performing right or you know should we stop them should

00:27.090 --> 00:30.140
we carry on should we make sure we increase our budget.

00:30.210 --> 00:31.740
What should we do.

00:31.740 --> 00:36.500
So this is a very important lecture because I've been titled this scale all killed.

00:36.510 --> 00:39.690
So we're going to scale up the ad or are we going to kill it.

00:41.470 --> 00:49.410
Now the first key thing I want you to do is to run your ad for three days or your ads depends on whether

00:49.410 --> 00:53.330
you do on the split split testing or not running for three days.

00:53.560 --> 00:55.260
Now why three days.

00:55.270 --> 01:01.120
Well it actually takes the Facebook algorithm a little bit of time 24 hours 48 hours I don't know exactly

01:01.120 --> 01:06.910
what it takes a little bit of time for it to actually start serving your ads up to the right people

01:06.970 --> 01:11.330
at a good cause is just kind of how it works is how the algorithm works.

01:11.350 --> 01:15.260
So you know I feel they do kind of scatter approach in the beginning.

01:15.260 --> 01:21.130
Obviously based on the targeting you've done and then they do kind of more clever targeting within their

01:21.130 --> 01:26.680
algorithm to actually try to identify perhaps better groups that are more likely to buy your stuff.

01:26.680 --> 01:30.010
But that process for them takes a little while and iteration.

01:30.070 --> 01:34.920
Don't worry about it too much but just accept the fact that you need to run it.

01:35.020 --> 01:38.290
It need to let your ads run for three days.

01:39.390 --> 01:43.380
Now your objective during this period is to make a profit.

01:43.390 --> 01:49.620
Surprise surprise or at least breakeven right now that might be that might seem a bit weird at least

01:49.650 --> 01:50.580
breakeven.

01:51.840 --> 01:54.280
You sorry I should say the least not least.

01:54.280 --> 01:56.150
But anyway you get the idea.

01:56.170 --> 02:06.340
So the reason why I cannot allow my ads to actually breakeven is because I will have acquired a customer

02:06.570 --> 02:12.460
and then later a later slide I'm going to talk about List Building the importance of a list the importance

02:12.460 --> 02:16.200
of a customer but basically just imagine you've got that customer.

02:16.210 --> 02:21.300
OK you haven't made any money out of them this time around but you will have the details of that customer.

02:21.310 --> 02:27.670
You will have the e-mail address you will have the opportunity to direct e-mail them in the future to

02:27.760 --> 02:28.800
make sales.

02:28.810 --> 02:31.090
And trust me that is very very valuable.

02:31.090 --> 02:35.310
You will make a profit down the road but maybe not straight away.

02:35.320 --> 02:40.240
So for the moment just accept that basically all you're doing is to make a profit or at least to break

02:40.330 --> 02:42.760
even.

02:42.810 --> 02:46.890
Now the reality is that not all of your ads are going to generate sales.

02:46.920 --> 02:49.590
OK so don't expect for one moment you might get lucky.

02:49.590 --> 02:52.960
Very first one starts to generate sales and you've got you know an embarrassment of riches.

02:53.130 --> 02:57.010
But basically it's it's unlikely the odds are stacked against you.

02:57.010 --> 02:59.580
That's just how it is that's advertising whatever you do.

02:59.580 --> 03:00.430
All right.

03:00.430 --> 03:09.280
And maybe only one in 10 of them will actually make a sale of some sort.

03:09.490 --> 03:10.120
OK.

03:11.530 --> 03:19.710
So what we want to do is if after three days an ad is not performing.

03:19.830 --> 03:23.290
We've not made a profit or we've not broken even.

03:23.320 --> 03:24.860
We want to kill it.

03:25.070 --> 03:30.200
We just want to stop that ad and I would suggest being brutal about it.

03:30.250 --> 03:32.160
OK that's certainly what I do.

03:32.200 --> 03:35.440
Some people will go down the path of saying well it didn't quite work.

03:35.440 --> 03:36.900
Maybe we should change.

03:36.910 --> 03:44.250
You know our target audience a bit or maybe we should change another thing on the ad the photo whatever.

03:44.500 --> 03:50.220
Personally in my experience you can go a little bit mad with that.

03:50.490 --> 03:55.450
What I tend to do is just say OK stop I am not doing this one anymore I'm killing it.

03:55.450 --> 04:00.270
I will go and find another product I might show to the same audience that I had before.

04:00.400 --> 04:03.770
But I will basically start over and I will kill it.

04:03.790 --> 04:07.510
And by the way I'll generally leave that product on my site because what you'll find is that as you

04:07.510 --> 04:11.200
do these products will start building building up on your site.

04:11.200 --> 04:16.180
And although you might not sell it this time around as a direct with the direct Facebook advertising

04:16.600 --> 04:21.490
later on down the road when you bring somebody else into your site for perhaps another product they

04:21.490 --> 04:23.770
will see that on your site and they may well buy.

04:23.770 --> 04:28.460
I've had many many situations where people come in to buy a product and end up buying three or four

04:29.340 --> 04:33.880
of stuff that I was not successful in previous test runs.

04:33.910 --> 04:37.260
Now this is the key point.

04:37.390 --> 04:42.810
The winning ad when you get a winning ad OK that can generate the dollars.

04:42.850 --> 04:48.280
So when you read you know not all ads will generate sales maybe one in 10 probably started thinking

04:48.340 --> 04:56.560
you know wow I'm going to have to spend quite a lot here on advertising to get that one sale which is

04:56.560 --> 05:01.380
you know maybe true maybe you know you can spend tens of dollars or something like that as part of this

05:01.390 --> 05:02.920
testing process.

05:03.280 --> 05:09.310
But when you get that winning ad Trust me that's when the fun starts because that's the one that can

05:09.310 --> 05:14.440
generate you know hundreds sometimes thousands I don't get you over excited about this but if you get

05:14.440 --> 05:20.930
the right ad matched up to the right audience that's going to pay for all of the rest.

05:20.950 --> 05:26.410
Multiple times over and that is where you're going to really build your business.

05:26.410 --> 05:32.260
So that's where we're going to actually scale the winning ad we've dropped the nonperforming once we

05:32.260 --> 05:35.530
got rid of those and we're left with the winning ad.

05:35.620 --> 05:36.480
Yeah.

05:36.850 --> 05:41.080
We're going to drop everything else and we're going to scale this up so that we can really generate

05:41.080 --> 05:47.470
some money and then the next lecture I'm going to give you some tips on exactly how to scale.
