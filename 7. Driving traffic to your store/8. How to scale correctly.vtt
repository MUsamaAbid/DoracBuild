00:02.480 --> 00:09.500
So you run your ad in the test period for three days and it's either created a profit or it's broken

00:09.590 --> 00:12.830
even so you have a winning test.

00:12.900 --> 00:15.060
And we talked about this in the previous lecture.

00:15.080 --> 00:16.400
You dropped all the other ones.

00:16.490 --> 00:17.630
Now what are you going to do.

00:17.630 --> 00:19.100
How are you going to scale this thing up.

00:19.100 --> 00:21.560
To start making some serious cash.

00:22.200 --> 00:30.760
Well rookie mistake number one do not be tempted to ramp it up by 100 x 100 times for example.

00:30.770 --> 00:32.560
So this is a classic mistake.

00:32.580 --> 00:34.790
You're spending $3 a day and you think.

00:34.790 --> 00:35.270
Right.

00:35.270 --> 00:36.130
I found it.

00:36.170 --> 00:43.880
I will now ramp up to $300 a day because if you do that and I can understand the temptation because

00:43.880 --> 00:49.730
suddenly going to much and enormous The not going reach a massive audience compared to before and presumably

00:49.760 --> 00:54.560
you know starts like 100 times more product and therefore 100 times more profit if you do that.

00:54.560 --> 00:58.980
What happens is you confuse believe it or not the Facebook algorithm.

00:59.000 --> 01:03.080
Ok just need to accept the Facebook and a little bit sensitive piece.

01:03.420 --> 01:08.480
And you can't just ramp up by 100 X in one go.

01:08.600 --> 01:14.440
So what it do do is you increase your budget by one and a half times.

01:14.530 --> 01:15.110
OK.

01:15.230 --> 01:23.450
So if you're spending $3 a day for example and you found the winning ad increase it to four and a half

01:23.720 --> 01:25.540
dollars a day.

01:25.550 --> 01:26.200
All right.

01:26.420 --> 01:33.950
So you go from $3 to for a half dollars and then at three and a half dollars keep that for another three

01:33.950 --> 01:34.760
days.

01:34.760 --> 01:37.040
So we are making baby steps.

01:37.130 --> 01:42.320
And in fact this makes a huge amount of sense because not only are we not confusing the Facebook algorithm

01:42.800 --> 01:48.980
but in business is duff to suddenly make huge increases in spending when you're still not 100 percent

01:48.980 --> 01:50.000
sure about this product.

01:50.010 --> 01:54.950
Sure the test period went well but what you still want to do is make little baby steps and make sure

01:54.950 --> 01:56.980
that you're on the right path each time.

01:57.050 --> 01:57.400
Yeah.

01:57.560 --> 02:02.190
Each time we go see just go from $3 multiply by one and a half.

02:02.240 --> 02:07.250
So four and a half dollars and keep it for another three days.

02:07.340 --> 02:12.580
Now at the end of that three day period it's the same question you need to ask yourself or you can say

02:12.580 --> 02:17.930
it on your on your manager did you generate a profit or at least breakeven.

02:18.200 --> 02:22.330
Yeah it's a yes or no question it's very very simple to answer.

02:22.490 --> 02:27.080
If I say yes then you increase the budget by another one and a half x.

02:27.080 --> 02:29.360
So we up for a half dollars.

02:29.540 --> 02:34.670
And if I try to do that in my head we're going to end up like six dollars let's say right a little bit

02:34.670 --> 02:35.130
more.

02:35.210 --> 02:42.310
So you know and I'll hold that for another three days and see if I can break Crear profit or breakeven.

02:42.710 --> 02:47.330
And if I do then increase it by another one and a half or three days.

02:47.330 --> 02:49.740
And so I'll go on and on like that.

02:49.760 --> 02:55.340
Now eventually you're going to get to you know spending a hundred or maybe 200 300 400 dollars a day

02:56.090 --> 03:01.700
but all the while you've been doing that you are making sales you're covering your costs very least

03:01.700 --> 03:04.760
if you're breakeven and if you're making a profit then happy days.

03:04.760 --> 03:11.930
So sticking my in the bank this is great stuff but if you don't do that what you want to do is go back

03:11.930 --> 03:14.000
to the previous budget.

03:14.000 --> 03:19.940
So any time in that in that loop of increasing the budget by one and a half X and holding it for three

03:19.940 --> 03:25.430
days if you don't make a profit just drop it down to where you before where you were before.

03:25.430 --> 03:27.200
Keep it for another three days.

03:27.320 --> 03:32.210
You know if it didn't work that time then maybe drop it back down again or if it did bring it back up

03:32.210 --> 03:32.680
again.

03:32.770 --> 03:33.300
Yeah.

03:33.560 --> 03:36.840
So you are making these small changes either way.

03:37.220 --> 03:40.780
And that is how you scale correctly.

03:40.800 --> 03:41.290
OK.

03:41.320 --> 03:43.060
It's it's baby steps.

03:43.070 --> 03:45.260
It's bit by bit it's patience.

03:45.290 --> 03:52.780
It's using your hard earned money correctly and wisely in order to generate profit.
