00:00.270 --> 00:04.620
So in this lecture I want to take the opportunity to talk about the ads manager because this is an interface

00:04.620 --> 00:06.810
that you're going to get very very familiar with.

00:06.810 --> 00:12.140
Trust me now like a lot of things it's highly complex is an enormous amount of information in here.

00:12.270 --> 00:14.840
But actually you don't need much of it at all.

00:14.850 --> 00:19.280
In fact what I'm going to show you in this lecture are the key things that you need to concentrate on.

00:19.500 --> 00:22.980
So you can run your business as efficiently as possible.

00:22.980 --> 00:29.730
Now what we have across the top here are four tabs you can view campaigns and sets an X for one set

00:30.000 --> 00:31.220
and basically we go left to right.

00:31.230 --> 00:33.870
We are going into more and more detail.

00:33.870 --> 00:40.530
So if I click on campaigns we have the campaign we set up and if I were to click on this link here is

00:40.530 --> 00:42.760
exactly the same as going to the ad sets.

00:42.780 --> 00:48.090
So if I click on this you'll see I go to the ad says and now this one is highlighted and if I click

00:48.090 --> 00:53.220
on that set I go to the AD when they had said Naoki tab.

00:53.220 --> 00:55.130
Here are the ad sets.

00:55.170 --> 00:59.600
This is where you're going to be spending most of your time to make the right decisions.

00:59.610 --> 01:03.720
I'm not saying all the information is here but certainly the key information is so I'm going to take

01:03.720 --> 01:06.530
you through this particular tapped and a bit more detail.

01:06.540 --> 01:07.970
Now this first column is the delivery.

01:07.980 --> 01:10.360
So basically they're both active at the moment.

01:10.360 --> 01:14.170
You can basically pause these will stop them entirely at any time.

01:14.190 --> 01:19.110
Now this next column results I'm going to come back to in a minute because that is the most important

01:19.110 --> 01:20.260
one.

01:20.310 --> 01:25.200
After that we have a reach which is base enough that the people that have seen my ad and then we've

01:25.200 --> 01:29.720
got a number of impressions which is the number of times Facebook has actually shown it.

01:29.780 --> 01:34.500
Then we got a cost per result so that gives you an idea for example of how many times Facebook has had

01:34.500 --> 01:41.400
to show the ad before somebody makes a purchase after that we got things like our budget the amount

01:41.400 --> 01:44.040
spent when it's going to end our share.

01:44.070 --> 01:50.250
And if we just go slightly to the right here we find something else of minor interest that people get

01:50.250 --> 01:55.800
slightly obsessed with that is the link clicks the number of times that people have actually clicked

01:55.950 --> 01:57.180
on your link.

01:57.180 --> 02:01.910
Now just before I go back to that Maimon the results column I do want to just show you this.

02:01.920 --> 02:07.980
OK so the columns can in fact be changed so you have all kinds of preset reporting going on here.

02:08.130 --> 02:10.360
And you can in fact customize them.

02:10.380 --> 02:15.840
Now I really don't recommend particularly in the beginning you get heavily involved in this because

02:16.170 --> 02:21.560
you potentially get lost in all of these stats and get more and more confused.

02:21.600 --> 02:26.610
And what I'm doing here is I'm showing you what you really really need to focus on.

02:26.610 --> 02:30.830
I'm taking you straight to the most important info.

02:31.020 --> 02:36.930
So by all means go ahead and indulge yourself but please don't confuse yourself and just go down some

02:36.930 --> 02:37.460
rabbit hole.

02:37.470 --> 02:39.630
It's very very difficult to come out of.

02:39.630 --> 02:41.540
Just keep it simple.

02:41.550 --> 02:47.630
Now on that note I want to go back to my key column here the results.

02:47.760 --> 02:52.130
Now this is what it's all about because we are in business here.

02:52.140 --> 02:56.270
And if people don't buy things from our site we don't have a business.

02:56.280 --> 03:03.960
It's as pure and simple as that that many people seem to lose focus of that absolutely key metric.

03:03.960 --> 03:09.030
Now the reason why we're seeing perches here is because I'm sure you remember when we set up the ad

03:09.330 --> 03:14.280
we set it to record the purchase event as part of our pixel.

03:14.280 --> 03:19.870
Had we set out to cart all some of those other events that I had shown you would see a different result

03:20.340 --> 03:25.320
but I choose purchase because purchase at the end of the day is really all that matters.

03:25.320 --> 03:30.120
So what you're going to see here is if as a result of asset one you have one sale you'll see a one in

03:30.120 --> 03:30.590
here.

03:30.720 --> 03:33.870
And if that's set to 100 cells you're going to see a 100 in here.

03:33.870 --> 03:37.780
And this is the thing that you ultimately want to keep an eye on.

03:37.790 --> 03:38.080
OK.

03:38.100 --> 03:39.360
This is the key.

03:39.530 --> 03:44.100
Now in the next couple of lectures Coming up we're going to give you some key knowledge so you can make

03:44.100 --> 03:48.430
the right decision about what you're seeing inside of your manager.
