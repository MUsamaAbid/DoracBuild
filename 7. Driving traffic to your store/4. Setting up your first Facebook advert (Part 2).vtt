00:00.710 --> 00:06.860
OK welcome back to Part 2 of creating your first Facebook at now I hope you clicked on that Continue

00:06.860 --> 00:10.730
button from the previous lecture and you're now looking at this page.

00:10.730 --> 00:14.450
And on this page it's all about creating the word itself.

00:14.450 --> 00:20.090
So once again I'm going to take you through the key points so you learn as quickly as possible what

00:20.090 --> 00:21.250
this is all about.

00:21.410 --> 00:26.200
So the first thing I'd do is give it a name so I'm simply going to call it advert one.

00:26.980 --> 00:32.000
Then what you want to do is set the identity now that simply means making sure that the Facebook page

00:32.000 --> 00:34.340
is correctly associated with the Ad.

00:34.610 --> 00:38.930
So if you've only got one Facebook page which is likely there won't be any options.

00:38.930 --> 00:42.850
I have various Facebook pages my own businesses and for teaching.

00:43.010 --> 00:48.620
So I get this little dropdown list box here but just make sure the appropriate page you set up all those

00:48.620 --> 00:50.620
lectures ago is showing up here.

00:50.660 --> 00:50.960
OK.

00:50.960 --> 00:56.090
So for me Tim's super deals now let's scroll down to the format.

00:56.300 --> 01:01.580
Now there are various formats available here but to get going in this first instance we are going to

01:01.580 --> 01:03.730
focus on the single image.

01:03.730 --> 01:11.210
So I want you to select the single image and then as we scroll down here we need to add an image median

01:11.300 --> 01:18.170
image on our Facebook is all about the images and a limited amount of text as you'll see.

01:18.170 --> 01:23.570
So clearly what I want is an image of my heart shaped pendant so all I need to do is click on upload

01:23.600 --> 01:28.310
images get that from my PC.

01:31.160 --> 01:32.710
And upload.

01:33.620 --> 01:39.320
Now it might not look quite right so you can click on this little thing here and you can basically position

01:39.320 --> 01:44.060
it as you want and you see it's going to show up on Facebook and on Instagram if I click on Instagram

01:44.150 --> 01:46.900
this is how it's to look and if you click on Facebook.

01:47.000 --> 01:47.900
That's how it's going to look.

01:47.900 --> 01:48.380
All right.

01:48.470 --> 01:49.700
So if you're happy with that.

01:49.790 --> 01:52.070
Just click on Don.

01:52.220 --> 01:58.900
Now with that out of the way the next thing we want to talk about are these links now there's links

01:58.900 --> 02:03.860
section is essentially all about where the customer is going to go once they click on your ad.

02:03.860 --> 02:06.240
Where is it going to link to.

02:06.350 --> 02:10.280
So you can see already the ad over here building up because the image is there already.

02:10.460 --> 02:13.880
But what I want to draw attention to straightaway is this Web site you're on now.

02:13.880 --> 02:19.880
This is where we want them to go and where we want to go is straight to the product page not to the

02:19.880 --> 02:21.400
home page nor anywhere else.

02:21.410 --> 02:27.340
We want to bring them for continuity straight from the advert to the parent page.

02:27.350 --> 02:31.910
We want that connection and not surprise at all by what they see.

02:31.910 --> 02:36.320
Once they click on the link so to get the link just go back to your store.

02:36.320 --> 02:45.530
In this case most all grab the link itself and then paste it into here.

02:47.820 --> 02:52.500
Now what you're going to see once it's done it's going to drag in some information so straightaway that

02:52.500 --> 02:58.830
you see that it's got heart shaped pendant in the headline and I'm sure you noticed that the text where

02:58.830 --> 03:03.510
there was really nothing here at all before it's now pulled in that text that we wrote on the product

03:03.510 --> 03:06.710
description page so would you love to own this shaped dog pendant.

03:06.810 --> 03:08.630
Show your love dogs high quality.

03:08.630 --> 03:10.650
And then it's cut off because of the limited space.

03:10.670 --> 03:15.000
But you can see this coming from this right.

03:15.030 --> 03:18.600
So what we want to do is just tidy some of this up now.

03:18.660 --> 03:24.540
Now the question as I said before many lectures ago is a great way to spark interest in your products.

03:24.540 --> 03:30.690
I'm going to keep that and I'm going to do now is add my limited text right my limited over text if

03:30.690 --> 03:32.780
we go back to the ad itself as well.

03:32.850 --> 03:40.290
I had only 50 left at this discounted price so I'm going to copy that and I'm going to paste it in here

03:40.380 --> 03:40.850
like that.

03:40.860 --> 03:41.360
OK.

03:41.730 --> 03:45.620
So now we see the ad previewing on the right hand side here looks pretty good right.

03:45.630 --> 03:47.670
Would you love to own this Heart-Shaped dog pendant.

03:47.700 --> 03:49.110
Only 50 left.

03:49.120 --> 03:51.280
This discounted price.

03:51.360 --> 03:53.550
Now the headline itself that's fine.

03:53.550 --> 03:55.210
Heart shaped dog pendant.

03:55.410 --> 03:57.640
That's exactly what it is you don't get fancy with that.

03:57.670 --> 03:58.170
Oh clever.

03:58.170 --> 04:00.990
You want to say exactly what it is.

04:00.990 --> 04:03.820
But the call to action we are not learning anything here.

04:03.820 --> 04:06.370
What you want to do is to go shopping.

04:06.570 --> 04:09.250
So let's find the shop now button.

04:09.270 --> 04:10.050
That's what we want.

04:10.050 --> 04:12.990
That's our call to action if you like.

04:12.990 --> 04:17.700
Now there are various other parameters in here but quite frankly you do not need to worry about any

04:17.700 --> 04:18.150
of it.

04:18.330 --> 04:20.280
All of this should be well set up.

04:20.280 --> 04:25.650
Now we've been through everything I've taken you through every single step and you now have your very

04:25.680 --> 04:27.350
first ad set up.

04:27.360 --> 04:29.910
So there really is only one thing left to do now.

04:30.240 --> 04:34.720
And that is simply to hit the confirm button.

04:34.740 --> 04:35.850
So there we have it.

04:35.850 --> 04:39.940
Facebook has accepted the ad and I'm now looking at the ads manager.

04:39.960 --> 04:42.540
I'm going to explain all of this very very soon.

04:42.540 --> 04:48.510
Now before we move on just one point you may see when you click on that confirm button you may see that

04:48.510 --> 04:53.310
you are prompted to enter in your payment details your credit card or your pay pal or whatever it is

04:53.580 --> 04:55.470
to obviously pay for your ads.

04:55.470 --> 04:59.370
Now for me that didn't happen because I have payment systems set up already.

04:59.640 --> 05:04.080
So you may not go straight to this but if you didn't just go through the payment process set that up

05:04.310 --> 05:08.670
and once that's done you'll be looking at a page very very similar to this.

05:08.700 --> 05:14.910
So super Congratulations you have now got your first ad in place now that took quite a long time.

05:14.910 --> 05:15.890
I appreciate that.

05:16.020 --> 05:18.170
But you get better and better this.

05:18.220 --> 05:23.460
And before you know it you'll be putting all kinds of ads and campaigns together very very quickly and

05:23.460 --> 05:24.390
efficiently.

05:24.810 --> 05:29.850
So in the next lecture and to complete this whole demonstration campaign we're going to do what's called

05:29.940 --> 05:31.440
a split test.

05:31.440 --> 05:33.510
So see you very very soon.
