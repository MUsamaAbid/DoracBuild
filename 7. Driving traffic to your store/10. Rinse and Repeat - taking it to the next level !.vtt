00:01.940 --> 00:06.410
So let's just take a step back and think about where we are right now because this is pretty cool stuff.

00:06.620 --> 00:13.730
You know we have learned a huge amount here so no one is talking about markets and how to identify markets

00:13.760 --> 00:17.410
how to identify products within those markets that are going to sell.

00:17.420 --> 00:21.590
And also the types of customers that are going to buy them through our customer avatar.

00:21.980 --> 00:28.580
We are now put in place a process via Facebook where we can target those types of people and we can

00:28.580 --> 00:35.450
bring them straight to our site in order they will buy them and not only that but we have a system in

00:35.450 --> 00:43.760
place a basic powerful system in place that we can easily follow to ramp up ads that are working and

00:43.760 --> 00:46.160
kill those that aren't.

00:46.190 --> 00:52.520
So in short you now have all the knowledge you need to rinse and repeat.

00:52.550 --> 00:53.370
Right.

00:53.390 --> 00:59.390
You know basically all you got to do now is go out find them all products find markets if you want find

00:59.390 --> 01:01.070
products in those markets.

01:01.070 --> 01:05.380
Test customer Avatar's you know build new ads.

01:05.420 --> 01:06.920
Go through that process.

01:06.920 --> 01:12.710
Weve been through in the last 20 or lectures or so and just keep rinsing it you know go over and over

01:12.710 --> 01:19.170
again and repeat repeat rinse rinse take the money from it each time and just keep going.

01:19.170 --> 01:23.630
But you're going to learn show you going to make mistakes but you can to learn on the way and you're

01:23.630 --> 01:29.360
going to start to make money and that you're going to start to realize how powerful this business model

01:29.420 --> 01:31.430
actually is.

01:31.430 --> 01:34.250
So go for it you know take it to the next level.

01:34.270 --> 01:35.450
It's entirely up to you.

01:35.450 --> 01:37.670
Now you know I'm giving you the wings.

01:37.850 --> 01:38.770
Now you can fly.

01:38.780 --> 01:40.430
So really really go for.

01:40.420 --> 01:41.570
I wish you the best of luck.

01:41.570 --> 01:43.670
Now clearly we're not done yet.

01:43.680 --> 01:49.490
We got we got a lot to discuss and I've got a lot more stuff for you which is going to help you even

01:49.490 --> 01:50.000
further.
