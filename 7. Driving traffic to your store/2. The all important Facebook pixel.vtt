00:00.600 --> 00:04.690
OK great so you've successfully set up your Facebook adverts account.

00:04.730 --> 00:09.900
Now the next key thing that we need to set up before we can actually start advertising is what's called

00:09.960 --> 00:11.410
the Facebook pixel.

00:11.430 --> 00:11.980
OK.

00:12.180 --> 00:13.600
Now what is the Facebook pics.

00:13.610 --> 00:15.740
Well it's a very clever piece of code.

00:15.930 --> 00:21.870
But all I want you to bear in mind at the moment is it's just a way of tracking customers that come

00:21.870 --> 00:22.800
to your site.

00:22.810 --> 00:27.820
OK so Facebook is going to send traffic from Facebook to your site.

00:27.880 --> 00:28.220
OK.

00:28.230 --> 00:34.320
And then the pixel is going to track and the pixel is going to understand the sorts of customers that

00:34.320 --> 00:39.360
are coming to your site and it's going to learn about them and it's going to increasingly send more

00:39.360 --> 00:42.600
customers that are more and more likely to buy from you.

00:42.750 --> 00:44.470
So it's a very clever piece of software.

00:44.490 --> 00:49.350
And the good news is you don't need to understand anything about it at all is going to do all the work

00:49.350 --> 00:49.960
for you.

00:50.160 --> 00:52.650
But we do need to get it installed.

00:52.650 --> 00:55.420
So let's see exactly how we're going to do that.

00:55.470 --> 01:00.750
Now with your Facebook account set up you should be able to find somewhere in your menu system.

01:00.750 --> 01:04.160
And again this will be potentially slightly different for most people.

01:04.290 --> 01:07.410
You should be able to find somewhere that says pixel's OK.

01:07.410 --> 01:08.740
That's what you're looking for.

01:08.910 --> 01:15.000
So what I've done here is I've opened up my menu system and in here I can see pixel's OK.

01:15.210 --> 01:17.220
That's what I'm looking for.

01:17.370 --> 01:24.240
Now if you don't see that just Google set up Facebook pics or something along those lines for your particular

01:24.240 --> 01:24.740
case.

01:24.870 --> 01:30.330
But within a menu somewhere you are going to see pixels and that's why I want you to click and he should

01:30.390 --> 01:32.150
land on a page like this.

01:32.160 --> 01:38.070
Create a Facebook pics or look at the Facebook pics onto your Web site to measure the impact of your

01:38.070 --> 01:38.800
ads.

01:38.820 --> 01:45.060
And as I was just discussing the pixel allow you to track your Web site activities and essentially improve

01:45.060 --> 01:49.970
your turn on investing and then keep sending customers that are more or more likely to buy from you.

01:50.100 --> 01:54.330
So all you need to do is to click on Create a pixel.

01:54.450 --> 01:59.280
Now we can give it a name it proposes Tim's super deals pixel which is absolutely fine with me.

01:59.280 --> 02:00.360
So let's click on Create

02:08.690 --> 02:11.690
and now we need to install the pixel code.

02:11.690 --> 02:12.170
OK.

02:12.380 --> 02:18.160
So it says here to use Facebook pixel you must first install pixel code on your website.

02:18.170 --> 02:20.410
What we want to do is take this first one.

02:20.450 --> 02:28.120
Use an integration or Task Manager so simply click on the option and then Shopify makes this really

02:28.180 --> 02:35.320
easy so click on the Shopify icon over here and it takes us through some very simple steps.

02:35.470 --> 02:41.060
So the first thing you want to do is to go to your Shopify admin panel and just before we do that I

02:41.070 --> 02:46.350
want to draw your attention to this number here because this is my pixel.

02:46.450 --> 02:47.580
D right.

02:47.740 --> 02:51.970
That number is the thing that I need to copy and paste into the appropriate place.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.040
I'm going to show you right now.

02:54.040 --> 03:01.600
So what do we need to do is to double click on that and copy it and then only to head over to your admin

03:01.600 --> 03:02.770
system.

03:02.770 --> 03:10.400
Go to your online store and then preferences and if you scroll down a bit here you're going to see this

03:10.400 --> 03:15.370
title Facebook pixel and all we need to do then is just to paste in that ID.

03:15.380 --> 03:21.190
So just right mouse click and paste and then obviously safe.

03:21.200 --> 03:23.470
Now let's go back to the instructions.

03:23.780 --> 03:25.840
So that's all done we've done one.

03:25.840 --> 03:27.080
We've also done two.

03:27.350 --> 03:33.530
The last thing we want to do is to check the pixel status and what it says is to go over to your manager

03:33.560 --> 03:36.160
and select pixels from the top menu.

03:36.560 --> 03:40.060
And if the status is active your pixel has been installed correctly.

03:40.220 --> 03:41.090
Now this is important.

03:41.090 --> 03:45.230
It may take up to 20 minutes for your pixel status to change.

03:45.230 --> 03:51.620
OK so what we're looking for is this here where we got pixel and then details and then status active.

03:51.620 --> 03:52.370
All right.

03:52.370 --> 03:53.920
So let's do exactly that.

03:53.930 --> 03:55.710
Let's close this now.

03:56.270 --> 04:04.760
Let's go over to pixel's and you should see this I got Tim super deals the pixel with the ID that we

04:04.760 --> 04:05.870
set up.

04:05.870 --> 04:06.620
Now ignore this.

04:06.620 --> 04:10.670
No recent activity for the moment because what you're really looking for here is this dot here this

04:10.670 --> 04:13.390
might be gray or it might be green.

04:13.400 --> 04:15.350
Now it needs to be green.

04:15.380 --> 04:20.660
Mine is green at the moment and if it's not green then just go to your adman's system and go straight

04:20.660 --> 04:21.810
to your store.

04:23.490 --> 04:32.010
Click around a little bit on the store just to trigger the pixel then go back to these aberant system

04:32.010 --> 04:35.570
here and just simply refresh the page.

04:35.970 --> 04:37.980
Now that should then be green.

04:37.980 --> 04:39.330
OK that's your Green light.

04:39.330 --> 04:40.980
Everything is done correctly.

04:40.980 --> 04:44.900
If not then you'll need to go back and just follow those instructions again.

04:45.270 --> 04:51.750
So if I now click on this pixel link it takes you to a dashboard specifically for the pixel now.

04:51.900 --> 04:55.550
We're not going to get into this in detail but I do want to show you just one thing.

04:55.710 --> 04:59.890
If you go over here to the diagnostics This is where you can ultimately check to see if your pixel is

04:59.890 --> 05:00.880
set up correctly.

05:01.080 --> 05:05.200
So having clicked on diagnostics You can see that it says there are no issues with your pixel.

05:05.220 --> 05:09.350
Enjoy your day because if you go back to events you might see this message here.

05:09.360 --> 05:12.920
No recent activity and it's still prompting set up the pixel.

05:12.930 --> 05:18.180
Now that's somewhat misleading but if is still not convinced you want to be absolutely sure and just

05:18.180 --> 05:22.060
go back to your store and add a few things into your cart.

05:22.080 --> 05:30.370
In other words create events on your site so if I add to cart here and then go to the checkout for example

05:31.250 --> 05:38.430
and now I head back to this page and refresh you see things have been updated so events received six

05:38.450 --> 05:40.200
so that's just me clicking around.

05:40.200 --> 05:45.830
And then if you look down here you can see that it's starting to record various things on my site.

05:45.830 --> 05:51.590
So there you go that's ultimate proof that the pixel is fully installed.

05:51.590 --> 05:56.330
So I hope you've managed to follow those instructions if you're tool confused or you're not seeing what

05:56.420 --> 06:00.910
I'm seeing here then just go back and go through it carefully again.

06:00.920 --> 06:05.930
All right you'll definitely get his it's not unnecessarily complicated process but you do need to be

06:05.930 --> 06:07.140
a little bit careful.

06:07.190 --> 06:07.910
So there we go.

06:07.940 --> 06:09.410
Pick so all installed.

06:09.410 --> 06:14.810
Finally we can start to drive traffic to our store and start making sales.
