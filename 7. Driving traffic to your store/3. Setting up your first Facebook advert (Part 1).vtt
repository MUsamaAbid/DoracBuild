WEBVTT

00:00.240 --> 00:05.620
So congratulations you made it to the point where we are going to create our very first Facebook app

00:05.640 --> 00:07.990
and drive traffic to our store.

00:08.010 --> 00:13.340
Now I'm going to use my heart shaped dog pendant as an example throughout this lecture.

00:13.350 --> 00:18.840
I'm going to show you how to set up the ad on Facebook and then how to actually bring targeted customers

00:18.900 --> 00:22.220
to your site so that they will buy it.

00:22.230 --> 00:27.960
So the first thing I want to head over to the ads manager now having set up your Facebook account you

00:27.960 --> 00:31.080
should have a button somewhere that says Create advert.

00:31.320 --> 00:35.100
And when you click on that you should be looking at a page something like this.

00:35.100 --> 00:39.870
Now I say something like this because Facebook is always a bit of a moving target and whenever I do

00:39.870 --> 00:45.930
Facebook teaching of any kind I always have to say that by the time you look at it it might look slightly

00:45.930 --> 00:52.200
different but that said This page has actually remained much the same for quite some time now.

00:52.210 --> 00:59.190
Now it starts off by saying what's your marketing objective and what we have here are three areas awareness

00:59.490 --> 01:02.340
consideration and conversion.

01:02.340 --> 01:06.090
Now awareness is all about building up your brand.

01:06.180 --> 01:13.530
Consideration is basically driving traffic to your brand and conversion is actually measuring how people

01:13.530 --> 01:20.490
do things once they are on your site and it's conversion that we're going to focus on now a conversion

01:20.490 --> 01:22.660
could be any event on your Web site.

01:22.680 --> 01:25.260
It could be simply visiting a page.

01:25.320 --> 01:31.920
It could be putting something into the cart or ultimately it could be buying something from your site.

01:31.920 --> 01:34.170
So we are going to do conversion ads.

01:34.200 --> 01:38.630
So the first thing we do is to click on conversions.

01:38.650 --> 01:44.820
Now if I scroll down a bit you'll see this conversions get people to take valuable actions on your Web

01:44.840 --> 01:45.360
site.

01:45.370 --> 01:45.950
All right.

01:46.060 --> 01:49.970
Such as adding payment info or making a purchase.

01:50.000 --> 01:56.860
OK just as I was saying and just here for completeness it says use the Facebook pixel to track and measure

01:56.890 --> 02:02.330
conversions right so that ties in very nicely with the last lecture where we set up the Facebook pixel.

02:02.440 --> 02:08.320
And I explained that it is doing exactly that it is tracking measuring conversions and bringing more

02:08.320 --> 02:10.390
and more targeted people to your site.

02:10.630 --> 02:15.370
But remember I also said you don't need to worry about it is working it's magic in the background.

02:15.370 --> 02:19.300
Now for the moment all we want to do is just create a campaign name.

02:19.540 --> 02:23.880
So I'm going to call mine the heart shaped dog pendant campaign one.

02:23.920 --> 02:27.690
Now that's a good name for a campaign because it says exactly what I'm advertising the Heart-Shaped

02:27.690 --> 02:33.780
dog pendant and I put a one on the end just in case I want to do other campaigns later on.

02:34.270 --> 02:41.920
So having chosen your campaign name and I suggest you use exactly that method click on set up an account.

02:41.940 --> 02:45.630
Now this is something you don't need to go through once when you're very first getting started.

02:45.630 --> 02:50.220
This page isn't going to keep on popping up all the time but it basically just asked me to set up my

02:50.220 --> 02:56.070
account so it's looking for my count country the currency I want to report in and my times and some

02:56.080 --> 02:57.690
skin to leave it not by default.

02:57.780 --> 02:58.390
Look at yours.

02:58.410 --> 03:01.350
Make sure you're happy and then simply click on continue.

03:03.470 --> 03:08.960
So what you get now is this fairly complex form which is essentially all about defining the audience

03:08.960 --> 03:12.890
that you want to target to bring to your site to buy your product.

03:12.890 --> 03:13.320
OK.

03:13.460 --> 03:15.500
Now things can get very involved with Facebook.

03:15.510 --> 03:21.410
What I'm going to do is I'm going to show you the essential items that you need to get started as quickly

03:21.470 --> 03:22.260
as possible.

03:24.140 --> 03:29.110
Now the first thing I want to do is come up with a set name so very unoriginal that I was going to call

03:29.230 --> 03:33.040
I had set or one her cage is purely for teaching purposes.

03:33.050 --> 03:36.360
You'll see later on that we're going to create an ad set too.

03:36.440 --> 03:36.930
OK.

03:36.980 --> 03:41.630
But for the moment just accept that we're going to call it and set one now the next thing is we come

03:41.630 --> 03:44.820
down to this controversial section.

03:44.960 --> 03:51.550
Now if I click in here you get to see various conversion events you remember just now.

03:51.560 --> 03:55.190
I said a conversion could be something that happens on your Web site.

03:55.250 --> 03:56.270
So let's have a look at some of these.

03:56.270 --> 04:00.300
We've got new content which basically means somebody viewing one of our pages.

04:00.470 --> 04:04.620
We've got an Add to Cart we've got and initiate the checkout process.

04:04.640 --> 04:06.920
Somebody doing a search adding to a wishlist.

04:06.920 --> 04:10.580
We don't actually have that on my site the moment adding their payment info.

04:10.580 --> 04:17.330
Making a purchase etc. These are all conversion events and you might notice that some of them are got

04:17.330 --> 04:22.610
a green dot next to them like this view content and some of them have got a red dot next to them like

04:22.700 --> 04:28.810
this purchase one here and a green dot basically means that that event has already fired on our Web

04:28.810 --> 04:31.790
site somewhere because this is the magic of the pixel.

04:31.790 --> 04:35.990
You remember when we were setting up the pixel I said you know if you don't see it basically being active

04:36.360 --> 04:39.510
to go to your site and just click around which is exactly what I did.

04:39.590 --> 04:41.540
And so I basically fired these events.

04:41.540 --> 04:46.790
I went I viewed the content you remember I added something to the cart so these are green but I never

04:46.790 --> 04:48.230
bought anything off my web.

04:48.230 --> 04:52.090
So for the moment the purchase one is red now.

04:52.100 --> 04:55.970
This is the very very clever bit the bit you don't have to worry about but this really is the magic

04:55.970 --> 04:56.980
of Facebook counts.

04:57.290 --> 05:04.310
Because if I select for example purchase what it means is that when somebody buys something from my

05:04.310 --> 05:07.070
site Facebook can see the profile.

05:07.070 --> 05:14.000
That type of person it can start to build up an idea of the sorts of people that are going to buy from

05:14.060 --> 05:15.260
my business.

05:15.470 --> 05:19.400
And then what it will do is it will send more people like that to my site.

05:19.610 --> 05:21.370
It starts to learn from itself.

05:21.380 --> 05:22.730
It's very very clever.

05:22.880 --> 05:27.710
And of course as in Facebook's interest clearly sent as much traffic as possible to your site to buy

05:27.950 --> 05:32.890
because if that happens you're obviously going to be spending more money with Facebook ads.

05:32.900 --> 05:38.150
So that's exactly what I want you to do is take the purchased event and then scroll down and talk about

05:38.450 --> 05:41.470
the all important audience.

05:41.480 --> 05:47.210
Now we're going to create a new audience and a way to scroll straight down to this location.

05:47.330 --> 05:50.270
Now by default it will have the country where you are currently residing.

05:50.360 --> 05:53.360
But what you want to do here is put in United States.

05:53.370 --> 05:56.750
We're going to target people in the U.S. to start with.

05:56.760 --> 06:00.560
Now obviously if you're already in the U.S. You don't need to do this but just select the United States

06:00.650 --> 06:01.700
as a country.

06:03.500 --> 06:09.770
Right now as we scroll down here we now get to play around with age gender and language.

06:09.770 --> 06:13.940
Now at this point we're talking about your only deal customer you are way back.

06:13.940 --> 06:18.860
We were talking about the customer Avatar the type of person who's going to buy your products.

06:19.010 --> 06:21.220
Well hopefully given that some serious thought.

06:21.230 --> 06:24.800
And if you haven't done you need to do that before you fill in this next bit.

06:25.040 --> 06:30.040
But basically that's where we're starting to define that now for our campaign.

06:30.050 --> 06:37.780
So for example with dog jewelry I know from experience that mostly it's women 35 and above.

06:37.790 --> 06:39.680
So I would put in here for the age

06:42.960 --> 06:51.920
35 select women and then here I basically want people who are English speaking the end of the day my

06:52.010 --> 06:56.400
site is in English so it doesn't make much sense to send people who aren't English speaking.

06:56.600 --> 07:01.310
Now at this point if you look over here you get this kind of barometer thing here and we get a potential

07:01.370 --> 07:05.000
reach of 66 million people.

07:05.000 --> 07:09.560
Now you might be thinking Wow that's incredible you know all I can do is get 1 percent of those and

07:09.560 --> 07:11.060
I've made a fortune.

07:11.270 --> 07:13.200
But it doesn't work like that.

07:13.340 --> 07:19.970
66 million people is way way way too broad for Facebook to start with to start to really understand

07:19.970 --> 07:25.880
your customer what you need to do in the beginning is to give Facebook a helping hand is to try and

07:25.880 --> 07:30.580
define as closely as possible the target audience your self.

07:30.770 --> 07:32.990
And then from there they will help you.

07:32.990 --> 07:38.540
But if you just give them literary too much too broad an audience in the beginning it's very difficult

07:38.540 --> 07:42.390
for them to figure out exactly who is the best person for you.

07:42.680 --> 07:48.320
So with that in mind we now come down to this detailed targeting section.

07:48.320 --> 07:53.780
So this is we're going to start to narrow down our audience now the detailed targeting relates very

07:53.780 --> 07:56.780
strongly to the buyers and communities lecture.

07:57.050 --> 08:01.460
And if you don't remember that because it was some time ago I really recommend you go back and watch

08:01.460 --> 08:01.970
that now.

08:01.970 --> 08:07.970
So basically what we've been talking about here with age gender and language use is more about the broader

08:07.970 --> 08:10.070
sense of the customer and Fatah.

08:10.290 --> 08:16.380
And now we're talking about detail targeting which is more related to the buyers and the communities.

08:16.380 --> 08:22.010
Now if you remember the buyers in communities like it was all about trying to find the people who are

08:22.100 --> 08:24.530
actually going to buy products.

08:24.680 --> 08:29.530
And I mentioned in that lecture Labradors and a product called bar box.

08:29.620 --> 08:35.970
And I'm going to use that now to show exactly how my thought processes work so I'm going to type into

08:35.970 --> 08:41.620
this first box Labrador and it's just a bunch of options.

08:41.640 --> 08:43.710
But I'm looking for the one most relevant.

08:43.830 --> 08:49.530
So I'm going to take a Labrador retriever which has nine point seven million people who are effectively

08:49.530 --> 08:51.640
liked that particular page.

08:51.790 --> 08:53.410
So take that.

08:53.410 --> 08:58.600
And now what I want to do is narrow the audience further so if you have watched that lecture on bising

08:58.650 --> 09:03.960
communities you'll remember that the Labrador retrievers find people will like Labradors but it doesn't

09:03.960 --> 09:06.140
necessarily mean they own one.

09:06.150 --> 09:12.180
But by narrowing the audience and bringing in let's say proof that people do own a Labrador then I am

09:12.180 --> 09:17.580
far more likely to hit the people who really own a Labrador and are therefore more likely to buy my

09:17.580 --> 09:18.520
product.

09:18.720 --> 09:24.510
So I'm going to click on narrow audience and here in accordance with my lecture I'm going to type in

09:24.900 --> 09:33.390
Barch box now just to remind you bump box is a company that will deliver periodically a bunch of goodies

09:33.390 --> 09:34.410
for your dog.

09:34.560 --> 09:38.510
So if you didn't own a dog that would kind of be a weird thing to ask for.

09:38.730 --> 09:41.640
So but for me is pretty good proof.

09:41.670 --> 09:48.010
Now the last thing I want to do is just to check this box here this ex-band interest box.

09:48.180 --> 09:53.220
Now at this point you'll notice the potential reach has fallen from several million to eight hundred

09:53.280 --> 09:56.990
thousand and that is exactly the area we want to be in.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.890
In fact you might want to write this down.

09:58.920 --> 10:03.300
Your target audience when you are testing because we are testing at the moment we are basically seeing

10:03.300 --> 10:06.800
if we can sell this product to this targeted audience.

10:06.810 --> 10:14.220
Your potential reach for your targeted audience at this stage should be between 500000 and 1 million

10:14.340 --> 10:14.800
ish.

10:14.850 --> 10:15.570
All right.

10:15.570 --> 10:16.490
Write that down.

10:16.490 --> 10:18.090
That's key.

10:18.120 --> 10:22.650
So your objective here is therefore to get a target audience within that band.

10:22.680 --> 10:28.380
Now less than 500000 really Facebook doesn't have enough to work with and more than that we are giving

10:28.380 --> 10:29.770
it too much to do.

10:29.820 --> 10:32.590
So that is the sweet spot.

10:32.640 --> 10:38.910
Now before we move on to the Form what I want to say is that for this business model this is where you

10:38.910 --> 10:46.620
are going to spend the majority of your time defining your target customer is the key to success of

10:46.620 --> 10:47.340
this.

10:47.460 --> 10:50.790
If you think about it up to this point it's been fairly formulaic.

10:50.800 --> 10:53.700
You know I can teach you how to build a Shopify store.

10:53.700 --> 10:57.930
We can go through all that we can make things look beautiful we can choose products we can get them

10:57.930 --> 10:59.000
from the Express.

10:59.130 --> 11:01.770
You are basically following a formula.

11:01.770 --> 11:07.950
But at this stage you really need to think about your customer Avatar and how you're going to apply

11:07.950 --> 11:09.720
it to your Facebook targeting.

11:09.750 --> 11:12.700
At this stage it is super super important.

11:13.080 --> 11:19.880
Or to put it another way if you don't you can find it very difficult to build out a really great business.

11:19.950 --> 11:23.190
So I trust that point is well and truly driven home.

11:23.220 --> 11:25.880
So let's carry on down through the form.

11:25.890 --> 11:30.720
Now the next thing we want to focus on are the placements now are by default.

11:30.720 --> 11:35.720
Facebook says it wants to do automatic placements for you but actually you don't want to do that.

11:35.730 --> 11:41.730
You want to click on edit placements and it pulls up all kinds of options.

11:41.820 --> 11:43.720
So to get this onto one screen here.

11:44.030 --> 11:48.240
Now first of all we have the devices mobile or desktop or both.

11:48.540 --> 11:51.010
Then we have all these various platforms.

11:51.030 --> 11:54.000
Facebook Instagram which of course is owned by Facebook.

11:54.000 --> 11:57.300
The audience network and Messenger.

11:57.300 --> 12:01.230
Now I don't want to get into a lot of detail about these different platforms.

12:01.230 --> 12:06.300
What I am going to say first of all is that what I do these days is I focus on mobile.

12:06.390 --> 12:09.570
The web goes more and more mobile every day.

12:09.570 --> 12:16.140
I'm sure you've seen the headlines and really targeting mobile is where you want to be is the best place

12:16.140 --> 12:17.310
to spend your money.

12:17.490 --> 12:23.070
So I always check on MOBA and you might see a small reduction in your potential reach but there you

12:23.070 --> 12:23.220
go.

12:23.220 --> 12:26.240
That proves really to me how important mobile is.

12:26.250 --> 12:28.000
We've lost 10000 people.

12:28.020 --> 12:30.050
That's all from our original estimate.

12:30.420 --> 12:33.990
Now for the platforms Facebook cause is absolutely fine.

12:34.170 --> 12:40.650
Instagram if you like but what I don't do it the audience network I find that it does not bring me any

12:40.650 --> 12:41.800
decent results.

12:41.820 --> 12:49.020
The audience network is effectively advertising or Facebook off Instagram with their so called partners.

12:49.030 --> 12:50.620
It will bring you traffic.

12:50.730 --> 12:56.100
I can guarantee that but it will bring you poor quality traffic it won't bring you people who will buy

12:56.160 --> 12:59.160
your product so effectively you're wasting your money.

12:59.190 --> 13:02.120
And for me I also put messenger in that same bracket.

13:02.160 --> 13:07.790
I don't feel that it really brings me any benefit so I leave with Facebook and Instagram and then that

13:07.830 --> 13:10.790
basically is it.

13:11.130 --> 13:15.210
So I can then continue down to the all important subject of the budget.

13:15.220 --> 13:19.600
And Cheryl now the budget is set at $20.

13:19.600 --> 13:21.450
Now that is way too high.

13:21.450 --> 13:23.450
We are testing this phase.

13:23.460 --> 13:28.880
We are testing as I said before see if we can basically sell this product to this audience and we therefore

13:28.890 --> 13:31.860
do not want to be spending $20 a day.

13:31.860 --> 13:37.680
So what I suggest you do my recommendation is always to spend between three and five dollars a day thats

13:37.710 --> 13:39.410
all you need to do in this test phase.

13:39.630 --> 13:44.460
You will see that once you find a winning product and will talk about this a bit later on once you find

13:44.460 --> 13:49.440
that winning product we will scale up we will scale up our budget and I'll teach you how to do that

13:49.830 --> 13:51.750
and you'll increase that potential reach.

13:51.770 --> 13:55.750
AUDIENCE you therefore increase your exposure and you will sell more and more.

13:55.950 --> 13:58.170
But in the beginning that is not our goal.

13:58.170 --> 14:00.750
We want to keep a tight budget.

14:00.810 --> 14:06.690
So I'm simply going to put in three here and then for the rest of this we really don't need to worry

14:06.690 --> 14:07.070
about it.

14:07.080 --> 14:11.040
All of this stuff we can simply accept.

14:11.090 --> 14:11.630
So there we go.

14:11.630 --> 14:16.340
That brings us to the end of the forms that you've carefully defined your audience and you've set up

14:16.340 --> 14:17.050
a budget.

14:17.120 --> 14:23.340
Now in the next part in part two coming up any second we are going to look at setting up the ad itself.

14:23.360 --> 14:27.490
So I want you to click on that continue button and I will see you in a second.
