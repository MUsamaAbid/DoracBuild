WEBVTT

00:00.680 --> 00:04.300
So you started driving targeted traffic to your site.

00:04.350 --> 00:07.900
Some people are buying hopefully some people putting stuff in the cart.

00:08.010 --> 00:09.960
Some people aren't doing anything at all.

00:10.140 --> 00:15.120
Now it will be kind of cool to be able to see what was actually happening on your Web site for each

00:15.120 --> 00:15.960
visitor.

00:16.380 --> 00:21.960
While you may not be aware but there are some fantastic software products out there one of them that

00:21.960 --> 00:25.340
I like in particular is this one here called Lucky orange.

00:25.500 --> 00:30.390
And basically it records everything that somebody does on your site.

00:30.390 --> 00:34.770
So it's almost as if you're looking over their shoulder as each and every one of your vistas comes to

00:34.770 --> 00:35.440
your site.

00:35.640 --> 00:36.720
So it's absolutely brilliant.

00:36.720 --> 00:42.480
For example with just identifying if there are any problem areas why people may not be adding something

00:42.480 --> 00:43.890
to the cart.

00:44.040 --> 00:50.280
You know you get to see exactly what it looks like on different supports on mobiles on on PCs on on

00:50.700 --> 00:52.020
iPads whatever it might be.

00:52.020 --> 00:54.510
You get to see all of that now.

00:54.840 --> 01:00.060
I don't think this is a long term thing that you need to do but certainly in the beginning when you're

01:00.180 --> 01:05.040
when you're basically getting started and you want to be sure you want to be confident that your site

01:05.070 --> 01:09.630
is performing to its best ability and you haven't missed out any tricks.

01:09.640 --> 01:12.660
So yeah you have the site as you can see by now.

01:12.690 --> 01:16.160
Lucky orange which does exactly that.

01:16.170 --> 01:17.190
I mean watch going here.

01:17.190 --> 01:19.850
What's the what's there little video on our home page.

01:19.850 --> 01:21.340
It's it's very intuitive.

01:21.480 --> 01:27.170
You'll see straightaway you know make use of the free trial if you want to use it then it's I think

01:27.230 --> 01:33.050
something like $10 a month but I'm not sure that's that's necessary that's entirely up to you.

01:34.050 --> 01:35.900
It's not the only game in town either.

01:35.910 --> 01:40.750
Of course this is another site called Harjo which does more or less the same sort of thing.

01:40.800 --> 01:45.990
And of course you know there are several if you if you google lucky orange competitors for example you're

01:45.990 --> 01:47.650
going to bump into a handful of these.

01:47.910 --> 01:52.230
I'm only drawing attention to these two because I'd use both of them personally I think they're great.

01:52.230 --> 01:54.680
They fit the bill very very well for what we're doing.

01:55.170 --> 01:58.440
So yeah definitely make use of these as always.

01:58.440 --> 02:02.730
Don't get obsessed by these sorts of things they're not the no silver bullet to solve all your problems

02:02.730 --> 02:06.250
or anything but they are definitely definitely extremely useful.
